# Quantum Ripple Carry Adder

This repository contains a Python script for creating and simulating a quantum ripple carry adder circuit using Qiskit. The script converts two decimal numbers into their binary representations, performs binary addition using a quantum ripple carry adder, and outputs the result.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `qiskit`
- `qiskit_aer`
- `numpy`

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install qiskit qiskit-aer numpy
